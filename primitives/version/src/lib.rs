/// An attribute that accepts a version declaration of a runtime and generates a custom wasm section
/// with the equivalent contents.
///
/// The custom section allows to read the version of the runtime without having to execute any code.
/// Instead, the generated custom section can be relatively easily parsed from the wasm binary. The
/// identifier of the custom section is "runtime_version".
///
/// A shortcoming of this macro is that it is unable to embed information regarding supported APIs.
/// This is supported by the `construct_runtime!` macro.
///
/// # Usage
///
/// This macro accepts a const item like the following:
///
/// ```rust
/// use sp_version::{create_runtime_str, RuntimeVersion};
///
/// #[sp_version::runtime_version]
/// pub const VERSION: RuntimeVersion = RuntimeVersion {
/// 	spec_name: create_runtime_str!("test"),
/// 	impl_name: create_runtime_str!("test"),
/// 	authoring_version: 10,
/// 	spec_version: 265,
/// 	impl_version: 1,
/// 	apis: RUNTIME_API_VERSIONS,
/// 	transaction_version: 2,
/// };
///
/// # const RUNTIME_API_VERSIONS: sp_version::ApisVec = sp_version::create_apis_vec!([]);
/// ```
///
/// It will pass it through and add code required for emitting a custom section. The information that
/// will go into the custom section is parsed from the item declaration. Due to that, the macro is
/// somewhat rigid in terms of the code it accepts. There are the following considerations:
///
/// - The `spec_name` and `impl_name` must be set by a macro-like expression. The name of the macro
///   doesn't matter though.
///
/// - `authoring_version`, `spec_version`, `impl_version` and `transaction_version` must be set
///   by a literal. Literal must be an integer. No other expressions are allowed there. In particular,
///   you can't supply a constant variable.
///
/// - `apis` doesn't have any specific constraints. This is because this information doesn't get into
///   the custom section and is not parsed.
///
/// # Compilation Target & "std" feature
///
/// This macro assumes it will be used within a runtime. By convention, a runtime crate defines a
/// feature named "std". This feature is enabled when the runtime is compiled to native code and
/// disabled when it is compiled to the wasm code.
///
/// The custom section can only be emitted while compiling to wasm. In order to detect the compilation
/// target we use the "std" feature. This macro will emit the custom section only if the "std" feature
/// is **not** enabled.
///
/// Including this macro in the context where there is no "std" feature and the code is not compiled
/// to wasm can lead to cryptic linking errors.
